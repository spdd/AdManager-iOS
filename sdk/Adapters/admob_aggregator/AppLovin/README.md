Rewarded Videos
====================
For rewarded videos integration, add the files GADMAdapterAppLovinRewardBasedVideoAd.h and GADMAdapterAppLovinRewardBasedVideoAd.m into your Xcode project. In the AdMob dashboard, add AppLovin as an ad network.

Note: For some versions of AdMob iOS SDK, you would also need to add the header files from the "Mediation Adapters", coming with the SDK, into your Xcode project.

Interstitials
