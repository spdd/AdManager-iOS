Unity Ads Mediation Adapter for Google Mobile Ads SDK for iOS

Prerequisites:
- Xcode 5.1 or higher
- Deployment target of 6.0 or higher
- Google Mobile Ads SDK 7.7.0 or higher
- Unity Ads SDK

Instructions:
- Add the AdMob SDK. Find the integration guide in the following link:
https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start
- Add or drag the adapter .a into your Xcode project.
- Drag the Unity Ads Frameowrk & Unity Ads bundle into your Xcode project. 
- You can find the SDK at https://github.com/Applifier/unity-ads-sdk

Caveats:
- The Unity Ads SDK does not provide a reward value when rewarded video completed,
  so the adapter defaults to a reward of type "" with value 1. Please override the
  reward value in the AdMob console.
